User story:
As a user
I want to login into system through the api
So I can access different features

Details:
You should use your loginUser method to login user into system and get his info instead of the usage of local storage.

Steps:
1. Use loginUser method inside SignIn component.
2. Provide separate pop-up messages if login isn't possible (examples: "User isn't found", "Password is incorrect").
3. After login user should be redirected to Games page.
