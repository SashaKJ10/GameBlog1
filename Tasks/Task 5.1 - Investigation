1. Review my commit "Different fixes".
2. Write down all structural changes you can notice below.

Structural changes:
0. (Example) Created updateGlobalSearch(search) method in Routing to encapsulate globalSearch modification.
1. Created  loadUserInfo, loadGames, checkSignedIn, loginAsync, logoutAsync in the  Routing component  mostly in order to increase readability.
2. Implemented separate functions to get the api data instead of doing all the work in a component itself.
3. Modified GamesApi and UsersApi files.
